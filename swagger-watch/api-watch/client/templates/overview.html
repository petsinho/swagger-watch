          The idea here is to be able to access all APIs that your microservices offer. All you need to do is run
          this meteor project (inside the meteor project, just run 'meteor' from command line). The swagger-watch will scann all
          directories in the same root folder as itself for a swagger.yaml file that will contain the API definition of your 
          application. Your part is done. Then swagger-watch takes over to create the directories that will host the pages with the 
          API definitions. You will be able to see everything from localhost:3000
